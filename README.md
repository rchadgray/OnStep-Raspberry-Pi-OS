# OnStepRaspbian
A Raspberry Pi Image for OnStep.

Currently this Raspberry Pi image is based on Raspberry Pi OS 32bit (release 1-28-2022) with SSH and VNC enabled.  It also has the Arduino IDE installed along with all of the libraries you need to compile the OnStep code.  Currently the OnStep code on the IMG is OnStep 4.24, Smart Web Server release 1.0 and the Smart Hand Controller release 2.1 code.

The default user and password is still pi and raspberry.  You burn this image to an SD card using Win32DiskImager.

I have placed the IMG file that you can burn to your Raspberry Pi on my website for now.

I need to research the GitHub Large File storage since it is 7GB.
